This file collecs expected behaviours from the water tank cases expressed both in 
natural language and possible STL assertions.

Here is a brief explanation on the system's signals:
-z:         variable representing the level of the the main tank;
-d:         variable representing the level of the the secondary tank;
-w:         variable representing the state of the weather at the moment, r is calculated using w (Not interesting in the mining procedure?)
-amount:    variable that calculate how much water has been wasted due to overflow
-a:         variable that control the return valve opening/closure;
-rain:      variable representing the rain/sunny behaviour(-1<=r<=0 for sunny, 0<r<=1 for rainy) ;
-clk:       clock that define the periods for max rain (r=1) or max sun (r=-1)

1. The wather changes based on fixed time intervals 
2. If the amount of water in main tank approaches max capacity, the valve to secondary tank would open
3.
